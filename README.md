# armored-fighting-vehicle-sim
This was a school project (I have permission to upload it here) that simulates the breaking and fixing of AFVs.

It creates a random amount of vehicles, categorizes them based on the amount of broken parts they have, fixes them using the good parts from the broken junk vehiicles, and tests the fixed ones. 

In this project, I learned how to:
-use data structures (queues, priority queues, lists, and veectors) to sort and move and manipulate objects
-object design and inheritence
-algorithms to properly sort and calculate characterists of vehicle objects
