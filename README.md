# armored-fighting-vehicle-sim
This was a school project (I have permission to upload it here) that simulates the breaking and fixing of AFVs.

It creates a random amount of vehicles, categorizes them based on the amount of broken parts they have, fixes them using the good parts from the broken junk vehiicles, and tests the fixed ones.
